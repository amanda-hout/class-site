    <p>Laurel Schwulst <i>My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?</i></p>
    <p>After one week of beginning to code a website, I very much see my website as a garden, in need of constant care and attention. While I personally love plants and gardens, sometimes they donâ€™t like me and this is a very sad occurrence. Even with all the attention, care, and watering a garden can still be unhappy. I currently feel like my website is an unhappy plant, with me having no knowledge of how to take care of it properly. As I get further into this class I look forward to my website growing and behaving, but right now it is a difficult plant. Like a garden with variety, different plants are bound to need different care. Some may flourish all on their own and some may require a good bit of work.  I knew this website wouldn't be a snake plant, resilient and strong, but I am hoping it will one day become a pothos with long trails of leaves, healthy and happy. </p>
